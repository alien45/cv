### Recommendations:

> "Toufiqur was my Co-founder at Totem and we worked together for 5 years. I highly recommend him as a full stack developer, he goes above and beyond to deliver, and simply gets what the requirements are with very little to go on. You could not find a better team player, contractor and technical expert. He is honest, straight-forward and driven. In the right circumstances I would not hesitate to work with him again and again."
> 
> **- Chris D'Costa**, Founder @ Totem Live Accounting

> "I've had the pleasure of working with Toufiqur twice - first as his mentor over a decade ago when he was a student, and more recently as a colleague at Omniscape.
>
>Even back then, Toufiqur stood out for his dedication and strong work ethic. Now, as a seasoned professional, he brings those same qualities along with years of valuable experience. He's a fantastic team member - equally capable of leading, collaborating within a group, or taking initiative and working independently.
>
>It's been incredibly rewarding to see Toufiqur grow over the years. I can confidently and wholeheartedly recommend him for any role."
> 
> **- Satwant Signh Kenth**, Co-Founder @ Omniscape
